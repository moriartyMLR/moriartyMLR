- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently making small projects while in college
- ðŸ“« How to reach me michaelmoriarty1247@gmail.com

I started gaining an intrest in programming around 15, and started learning html/css
but when I got to learning JS, I didn't like it, stopped learning for a few years then picked up python in mid 2021.
I've come pretty far with python but still learning the process of actually developing programs.
I have a strong interest in other languages but I don't want to get ahead of myself for now.
